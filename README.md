# ASM compiler

Just a basic compiler for people Who wants to code in asm but are to lazy to compile it.<br>
Probably not perfect I don't care.

# Installation :
Put the asm.bat file wherever you want.<br>
Go in options and just configure it if you want.<br>
It basically uses nasm and gofile but you can change all compiling options with your compiler : IT'S FULLY CONFIGURABLE.<br>
